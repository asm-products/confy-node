# confy-node

Official Confy API library client for node.js

__This library is generated by [alpaca](https://github.com/pksunkara/alpaca)__

## Installation

Make sure you have [npm](https://npmjs.org) installed.

```bash
$ npm install confyio
```

#### Versions

Works with [ 0.8 / 0.9 / 0.10 / 0.11 ]

## Usage

There are two ways of loading the config.

 * You can either load it as a hash object with the same structure into a variable.
 * Or you can load it directly into `process.env` with the key formed by concatenizing the path keys with underscores.

```js
var confy = require('confyio');

// When the config is
// => { 'port': 6000, 'db': { 'pass': 'sun' } }

// Using URL
confy.config.env('https://user:pass@api.confy.io/orgs/company/project/app/envs/production', callback);

// or using options hash
confy.config.env({
  host: 'https://api.confy.io', user: 'user', pass: 'pass',
  org: 'company', project: 'app', env: 'production'
}, callback);

// Callback is given below
function (err) {
  // ['port']
  process.env.PORT // => 6000

  // ['db']['pass']
  process.env.DB_PASS // => 'sun'
}
```

```js
// Retrieve the config using URL
confy.config.load('https://user:pass@api.confy.io/orgs/company/project/app/envs/production', callback);

// or using options hash
confy.config.load({
  host: 'https://api.confy.io', user: 'user', pass: 'pass',
  org: 'company', project: 'app', env: 'production'
}, callback);

// Callback is given below
function (err, config) {
  config.port // => 6000
  config.db.pass // => 'sun'
}

// Or you could instantiate a client to work with other api (as shown below)
```

### Build a client

__Using this api without authentication gives an error__

##### Basic authentication

```js
var auth = { username: 'pksunkara', password: 'password' };

var client = confy.client(auth, clientOptions);
```

### Client Options

The following options are available while instantiating a client:

 * __base__: Base url for the api
 * __api_version__: Default version of the api (to be used in url)
 * __user_agent__: Default user-agent for all requests
 * __headers__: Default headers for all requests
 * __request_type__: Default format of the request body

### Response information

__All the callbacks provided to an api call will receive the response as shown below__

```js
// You can also omit the 'methodOptions' param below
client.klass('args').method('args', methodOptions, function (err, response) {
    if (err) console.log(err);

    response.code;
    // >>> 200

    response.headers;
    // >>> {'x-server': 'apache'}
}
```

##### JSON response

When the response sent by server is __json__, it is decoded into a hash

```js
response.body;
// >>> {'user': 'pksunkara'}
```

### Method Options

The following options are available while calling a method of an api:

 * __api_version__: Version of the api (to be used in url)
 * __headers__: Headers for the request
 * __query__: Query parameters for the url

 * __request_type__: Format of the request body

### Request body information

Set __request_type__ in options to modify the body accordingly

##### RAW request

When the value is set to __raw__, don't modify the body at all.

```js
body = 'username=pksunkara';
// >>> 'username=pksunkara'
```

##### JSON request

When the value is set to __json__, JSON encode the body.
